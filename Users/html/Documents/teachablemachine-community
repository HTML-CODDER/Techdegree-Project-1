your current agreements on file or to sign a new one.

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one
(even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it
again.

## Code reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult

## NEW:

Want to bring Teachable Machine into your own web creations?

We’re working on a library called _teachablemachine.js_ which will let you do just that. Here’s the first remixable demo you can play with to get a sneak peek at what’s possible:

[Hello Wizard](http://glitch.com/edit/#!/tm-wizard?path=README.md%3A1%3A0) - This demo shows how you can drop a machine learning “training wizard” on top of your website with just a few lines of code.

Look out for more demos coming soon.

Email us at teachablemachine-support@google.com if you’d like to chat more about teachablemachine.js. We’re interested in hearing what developers might like to create with it.

### What is Teachable Machine?

[Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) is a web-based tool that makes creating machine learning models fast, easy, and accessible for everyone. [You can try it here](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/).

### Who is it for?
Educators, artists, students, innovators, makers of all kinds – really, anyone who has an idea they want to explore. No prerequisite machine learning knowledge required.

### How does it work?
You train a computer to recognize your images, sounds, and poses without writing any machine learning code. Then, use your model in your own projects, sites, apps, and more.

### What is this repository for?

This repository contains two components of [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/):

1. **A [libraries](/libraries) section** that contains all of the machine learning code used in Teachable Machine. Under the hood we use [Tensorflow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js), a library for machine learning in Javascript, to train and run the models you make in your web browser. The `libraries` section also contains the API for [image](/libraries/image), [audio](/libraries/audio), and [pose](/libraries/pose) helper libraries that make it easier to use the models exported by Teachable Machine in your own projects.

2. **A [snippets](/snippets) section** that contains markdown snippets that are being displayed inside the export panel in [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/). These snippets contain code and instructions on how to use the exported models from Teachable Machine in languages like Javascript, Java and Python.

### How can I send feedback?

You have a few options:

* Email us at [teachablemachine-support@google.com](mailto:teachablemachine-support@google.com).
* Share your projects using [#teachablemachine](https://twitter.com/hashtag/teachablemachine) on Twitter or on the [Experiments with Google](https://experiments.withgoogle.com/submit) page.
* Open an issue in this repository.

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the

      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,

      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
